Back in 2006, In my free time, I set to write a web application to manage the contacts, members of the basketball club I was playing for.

This repository contains the source code for that web application.

## Important

I don't plan to do any maintenance for it. 

It was built for old versions of php and jquery with practices long forgotten in modern development.
The code hasn't been touched for 10+ years.

So, feel free to use but be aware of those limitations.

In case you need any support, feel free to reach out nonetheless.

Would need to be converted to PDO and double check that inputs are sanitized.

Need PHP upgrade to latest standard and getting rid of deprecations (from php4)

## NOT WORKING AS IS ##

## Install

Should probably be done via the install/index.php script but this hasn't been tested/use since 200X
